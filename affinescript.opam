synopsis:
  "A programming language with affine types, dependent types, row polymorphism, and extensible effects"
description:
  "AffineScript combines Rust-style ownership (affine types), compile-time size verification (dependent types), extensible records (row polymorphism), and trackable side effects (extensible effects). It compiles to WebAssembly for efficient, portable execution."
