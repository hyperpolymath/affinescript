## How to Use These Lessons

### Option 1: Read Online
Each lesson is a markdown file you can read on GitHub.

### Option 2: Interactive Playground
1. Open the [Playground](../../../playground/test.html)
2. Load the lesson example (e.g., `examples/lessons/01_hello.as`)
3. Follow along by running code as you read

### Option 3: Clone and Experiment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/affinescript
cd affinescript
./affinescript examples/lessons/01_hello.as
```

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll understand:

✅ **Basic Syntax** - Variables, functions, types
✅ **Affine Types** - Resource safety without complexity
✅ **Dependent Types** - Compile-time correctness proofs
✅ **Refinement Types** - Constrained values (non-zero, positive, etc.)
✅ **Effect System** - Track side effects in types
✅ **Row Polymorphism** - Flexible structural typing
✅ **Error Handling** - Option, Result, exceptions

And you'll be able to:
- Write type-safe, memory-safe programs
- Prove correctness at compile time
- Build real applications with confidence

## Learning Path

### Beginner Track (Lessons 1-2)
Start here if you're new to AffineScript or typed languages.

### Intermediate Track (Lessons 3-6)
Core type system features. This is where AffineScript shines.

### Advanced Track (Lessons 7-10)
Real-world programming with effects, errors, and composition.
